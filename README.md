## Classmate

Welcome to 𝒞𝓁𝒶𝓈𝓈𝓂𝒶𝓉𝑒 , your place to add,update,delete,and edit a to-do list of task to help you manage your time in this co-hort. You can play background music, add notes and tips for other classmates to see,  view your list of task (arranged by priority from 1-5) and use a built in timer all without leaving the page! As a bonus, also built a custom favicon and logo and background. Happy Hacking!
